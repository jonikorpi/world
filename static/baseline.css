/*
  1 rem == baseline grid unit.
  The calc() function flexes the baseline grid,
  making everything automatically a bit bigger on larger screens,
  as long as you set every font-size, line-height, margin, padding etc.
  in rems.

  Edit the em value to change the grid's base size,
  but make sure the font-sizes still feel good on small screens.

  Edit the vw/vh/vmin values to change how much the grid flexes,
  but make sure your body text doesn't get huge in large viewports.
